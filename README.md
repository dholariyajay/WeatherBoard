# WeatherBoard
Beautiful and functional Weather Dashboard (using MERN) that demonstrates all key concepts of RESTful APIs.

We've build a Weather Dashboard that allows users to:

Search for weather conditions in different locations
View detailed forecasts
Save favorite locations
Create weather alerts
View historical weather data
Customize dashboard appearance

This single-page application will connect to external weather APIs while implementing our own RESTful API backend.
